# Student Performance Analyser

This project is designed to analyze and predict student performance based on various academic and socio-economic factors. It uses machine learning techniques to explore patterns and build predictive models using historical student data.

## Project Overview

The application allows users to:
- Perform exploratory data analysis (EDA) on student datasets
- Train machine learning models to predict performance
- Visualize relationships between features and student outcomes
- Deploy predictions using a web interface

## Features

- Data ingestion and preprocessing
- Feature engineering
- EDA with interactive charts and graphs
- Model training using CatBoost and other algorithms
- Web-based prediction using Flask
- Reusable pipeline architecture

## Technologies Used

- Python
- Pandas, NumPy
- Scikit-learn, CatBoost
- Matplotlib, Seaborn
- Flask
- HTML (Jinja Templates)
- Git & GitHub
